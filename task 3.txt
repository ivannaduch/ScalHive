Dear Mr.  Jensen,

I am currently a candidate for position  QA trainee, I have reviewed the  
requirements for 'Add contact' form, and I would like clarify some things.

Data validation

•	What is the system response, if user has already exist to contacts form?
•	What is the type of data validation in the fields?
•	What is the system response, if user close the form and did not save the entered data before?
•	How many others fields 'Email and Phone' user can add?
•	Is the field 'Name' could contains space without any characters?

Security validation 

•	Can a user copy the data and paste to the fields with CTRL + C and CTRL + V?

Please review my letter with questions regarding 'Add contact' form, 
and I hope to get the response regarding clarification of requirements.
I really appreciate your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Ivan Nadych.
